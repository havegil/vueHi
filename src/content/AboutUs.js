                            <h2>We are independent</h2>
                            <p>Being independent allows us to be our own stakeholders. Decisions are made based on who and what
                matters most: our clients and their brands.</p>
                            <p>We have the freedom to take calculated risks. We have the luxury of working with the clients we truly
                want to work with in a way that ensures that they get the services and support they need and deserve.</p>
                            <p>There are no silos. We come at communications from a unique VUE. Sound strategic thinking takes into
                account medical, commercial, and creative, right from the start.</p> 
                            
                            <p>As an independent agency, we also attract a different kind of talent. Our people value autonomy, are
                empowered, and have entrepreneurial instincts. It allows us to build your team with senior-level
                professionals who really do love what they do.</p>
